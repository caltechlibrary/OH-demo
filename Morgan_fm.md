# Abstract

> Interview in 1999 with James J. Morgan, Marvin L. Goldberger Professor
> of Environmental Engineering Science, emeritus. Born in New York City
> to Irish immigrant parents, Morgan was raised in County Monaghan,
> Ireland, during the Depression. He studied civil engineering at
> Manhattan College, received a master's degree from the University of
> Michigan in environmental health engineering with C. J. Velz (1956),
> and after three years as an instructor at the University of Illinois
> took his PhD at Harvard in 1964 with the water chemist Werner Stumm.
> Morgan came to Caltech in 1965 to join the environmental engineering
> science program in the Division of Engineering and Applied Science,
> where he worked on manganese chemistry in water and the use of
> polyelectrolytes in water treatment. Recollections of colleagues Jack
> McKee, Sheldon Friedlander, Norman Brooks, and the early years of the
> environmental engineering science program. In 1966 he became first
> editor of the American Chemical Society's journal *Environmental
> Science and Technology*. Recalls stint on Caltech's Freshman
> Admissions Committee and as dean of students in the early 1970s.
> Coauthored *Aquatic Chemistry* with Werner Stumm. Comments on his
> consulting for industry and government in the 1970s. Becomes vice
> president for student affairs (1980-1989). Recalls postdocs and
> students, including François Morel, James Pankow, Alan Stone, Howard
> Liljestrand, Yigal Erel, Windsor Sung. Awarded 1999 Stockholm Water
> Prize jointly with Werner Stumm (d. April 1999). In an epilogue to
> this interview, Morgan describes his trip to Stockholm to accept the
> award on behalf of Stumm and himself and his receipt that year of the
> Clarke Prize of the National Water Research Institute.
